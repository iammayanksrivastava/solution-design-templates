# Objective 

Why do you want to write this solution design document? What is the problem you want to solve?

# Expectation from the review Board 
Be very clear about what you expect from the members of the review board if you are presenting your design to an audience that needs to approve it. That helps keep the audience focussed and not propel them into unnecessary discussions and also provides them a clear idea of what to look for or observe in the design.
- Approval ask 1
- Approval ask 2
- Approval ask 4

# Comparison and final Recommendation 

Creating a table in markdown is very difficult. What I normally do is, I create it in excel and use an online tool to convert that excel to markdown. I normally use [Excel to Markdown](https://tabletomarkdown.com/convert-spreadsheet-to-markdown/ ) for this purpose.It is free and very easy to use.
